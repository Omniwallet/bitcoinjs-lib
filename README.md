# bitcoinjs-lib

A library containing Bitcoin client-side functionality in JavaScript,
most notably ECDSA signing and verification.

# BitGo improvements

BitGo made quite a few improvements, including:

* An option to configure the library to use testnet
* Sending to P2SH addresses
* Multisignature signing
* Bug fixes
* Code cleanup
* Client side transaction creation
* Use of SJCL RNG
* A build script
* Can be used both client side and server side (node.js)
* More tests

# Status

This is currently pretty raw code. We're planning to clean it up,
convert everything into CommonJS modules and put a flexible build
system in place.

Prototype software, use at your own peril.
